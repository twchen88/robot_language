Instructions:

To set up:
	1. Install all requirements with pip3 in requirements.txt
	2. Replace speech.py and pickup.py in the cozmo_tools/cozmo_fsm folder with the new 
	   speech.py and pickup.py provided
	3. Everything else downloaded should be in the same directory as Final.fsm and cozmo_tools 
	   should be in the same directory as Final.fsm

To run:
	1. genfsm Final.fsm
	2. simple_cli
	3. runfsm('Final')
	4. Wait for Cozmo to ask you to say something saying "jeh shah laino" and for 
	   "Listening..." to pop up in the terminal 
		This may take some time due to the import of our Chinese NLP segmentation module
	5. Say one of the following supported commands:
		方块一 (grab cube 1)
		方块二 (grab cube 2)
		方块三 (grab cube 3)
		天气 (get the weather)
		行事历 (create a Google calendar event)
			Note: To use this with your Google Calendar, 
			      you need to follow steps 1 and 2 here:
			      https://karenapp.io/articles/how-to-automate-google-calendar-with-python-using-the-calendar-api/
			      You will also need to remove the existing version of token.pickle so 
			      that a new one can be generated using cal_setup.py after following 
                              steps 1 and 2 and before running runfsm
		重复 (repeat what you say)
		翻译 (translate)
		拍照 (take a picture)

	   *Note: anything else will produce an error message since Cozmo is still learning 
                  Mandarin :)
	6. Run as many times as you like, but wait for him to prompt you for a new command with 
           "jeh shah laino"
	7. Ctrl + "\" to end the program
